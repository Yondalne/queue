# queue
simulate a counter queue

In a train station a ticket office is open. Customers arrive at random dates and queue up.
The interval between the arrival of two successive customers is a random number between 0 and INTERVALMAX in seconds or minutes. 
When the teller is finished with a customer he calls the next customer and the treatment has a duration between 0 and DUREETRAITEMENTMAX.

In my program 
- DUREETRAITEMENTMAX = traitementMax     
- INTERVALMAX = intervalMax
- duree_max_service represent the limit of execution for the service (train)
